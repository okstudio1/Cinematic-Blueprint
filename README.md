## Using the Storyboard

### Creating Shots
1. Click the **Storyboard** button in the toolbar
2. **Drag images** from File Explorer directly onto the storyboard — each image becomes a shot
3. Or click the **+ Add Shot** card to add a shot manually

### Editing Shots (Inline)
Click directly on any field to edit it:
- **Shot number** — e.g., "1", "1A", "2B"
- **Description** — What happens in the shot
- **Camera** — e.g., "Wide", "CU", "Dolly in"
- **Duration** — e.g., "5s"

Press **Enter** to save, **Escape** to cancel.

### Saving & Loading Your Storyboard
1. Click **Export** → Downloads `storyboard.json`
2. Save this file somewhere safe (e.g., your project folder)
3. To continue later: Click **Load** → Select your `storyboard.json` file
4. Your shots, images, and all metadata are restored

> **Important**: The JSON file stores image data, so your images will appear when you reload. Keep the JSON file — it's your save file!

## Multi-Project Organization

This tool is designed to be deployed per-project. Recommended structure:

```
my-video-project/
├── cinematic-blueprint.html  # The tool (copy this)
├── project.json              # Project config (auto-created)
├── story-beats/              # Beat card exports
│   ├── story-beats-v1.md
│   └── story-beats-v2.md
├── storyboard/               # Storyboard exports
│   └── storyboard-v1.json
└── images/                   # Reference images for storyboard
    ├── shot-001.jpg
    └── shot-002.png
```

### Deploying to a New Project

1. Copy `cinematic-blueprint.html` to your project folder
2. Create an `images/` folder for reference images
3. Open the HTML file — it auto-creates config on first export

### Image References

The storyboard stores **file paths** or **URLs** to images, not the images themselves:
- Drag images from your file explorer → stores relative path
- Paste image URL → stores the URL
- Images stay in your project's `images/` folder

This keeps your storyboard file small and Git-friendly.
